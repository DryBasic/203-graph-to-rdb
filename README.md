# GraphToRDB Demo

Please refer to `demo.ipynb` for an interactive demo of the graph transformer package using data from neo4j's demo movie database.

Note that while the recommended usage is to treat the package as a simple object with your relational output as an attribute, 
several utilities can be accessed for "non-standard" workflows. One such example being the schema validation utilities.  

### Getting Started
Download the GraphToRDB directory and reference it as an import within your project as done in the demo notebook. Dependencies/requirements are listed in the `pyproject.toml`. They are also listed in the first cell of `demo.ipynb`.

The `example_map.yml` may be helpful to use as a template when writing your own configs. The `example_data.json` file represents the JSON exports generated by [neo4j's APOC export utility](https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/export/json/). JSON that does not match this schema will raise exceptions.  

**Requirements**
* Python versions >= 3.10 (uses `match case` statements)
* Packages listed in ...

**Your Inputs**
* A valid mapping config
    - takes `.yml` files or a dictionary
* Data in a valid JSON schema
    - takes a `.json` lines file or a list of JSON objects

### Notes on Mapping Config Schema
For relationship tables, there is no need to specify the from and to node ids as properties/fkeys. This mapping will be done automatically.
The schema allows for relationships without properties, but not for nodes without properties.
